Blackjack game




The rounds are still kinda buggy, 60%-70% of the rounds are fine, they quite working well. I need to work more on checktable() function to fix bugs
Another problem of its is everytime someone picks A from the deck, client asks for 1 or 11 value. Even bots picks A from deck, player answering 1 or 11 question for bots. I still dont have no idea how to fix it.
